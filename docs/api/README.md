# API Documentation

API documentation is divided and defined per resource.

Error responses are defined with the media-type [application/problem+json](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc7807). In the **Problems** section you can find the errors specification.

A diagram of the relation between resources is shown [here](api_resource_diagram.svg).

## Resources
